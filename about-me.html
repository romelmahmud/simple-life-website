            My name is John and living the simple life saved my life
          </h2>

          <p class="about-me-body">
            <strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that
            I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate
            any of it because there was too much.
          </p>
          <p class="about-me-body">
            Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't
            want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
          </p>
          <h2 class="about-me-subtitle">How I turned things around</h2>
          <p class="about-me-body">
            <strong
              >I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of
              everything.</strong
            >
            I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place
            and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
          </p>
          <p class="about-me-body">
            It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad
            place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
          </p>

          <h2 class="about-me-subtitle">Now I live the simple life</h2>
          <p class="about-me-body">
            Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm
            less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time
            to enjoy.
          </p>
          <p class="about-me-body">
            With how much it turned my life around,
            <strong
              >I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did
              it,</strong
            >
            and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which
            is why I started this site!
